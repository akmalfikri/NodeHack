# Dreadnodes - the awesome version of Battleships

Dreadnodes is similar to the classic game [Battleships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)), with several twists: (1) up to 8 players can play together; (2) up to 10 spectators can watch over an on-going game; (3) each player only gets one ship.

The player who survives to the end is considered the victor.
