# NodeHack - a NodeJS Hackfest

NodeHack is organized by [40 Square Software](http://40square.com) and generously hosted by [Mindvalley](http://www.mindvalley.com/). It is an event where participants gather together to learn more about NodeJS, and hack out usable and workable prototypes by the end of the session.
